# Identity Management
## Authentication
- Proving the identity (who you are)

## Authorization
- Proving right to access (what you can do)


## Authentication
### Credentials Transfer
1. HTML Forms
    - HTTP Post over SSL/TLS
2. Http Basic
    - HTTP methods over SSL / TLS
    - Base 64 encoded <UserId>:<Password>
    ```js
    Authorization: Basic astYsDsfdgreY=
    ```
3. Digest Based
    - Like basic, but uses hashed password
    - Hash = MD5(username:realm:password)
4. Certification Based
    - Private-Public key based certificates exchanged
### Credentials Storage & Verification
1. File storage
    - It is possible. But definitely not recommended.
2. Database
    - RDBMS
    - NoSQL
3. LDAP / Directory Server
    - **Architecture**
    - Hierarchical database designed for reading, browsing, searching organization data.
    - High scalability and high performance for read loads
    - LDAP is the protocol (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
    eg:- Azure Active Directory
    - **Environment**
    - Enterprise environment with multiple applications
    - interoperability with all LDAP clients
    - Distributed / Federated Storage
### Stateful Authentication
- Uses Sessions to Authenticate
- Limited Scalability due to Session Cache and Centralized Authentication
- Sessions can be revoked by removing it from session storage
### Stateless Authentication
- signed or encrypted tokens with claims
- decentralized authentication leads to better scalability
- requires centralized store for immediate token revocation
- *The token needs to be stored inside an **httpOnly cookie**, a special kind of cookie that's only sent in HTTP requests to the server, and it's never accessible (both for reading or writing) from JavaScript running in the browser.*

### Single Sing-On
