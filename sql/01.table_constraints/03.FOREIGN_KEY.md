## Foreign Keys
- Foreign Keys are used to enforce database integrity. 
- The foreign key constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column.
- The values that you enter into the foreign key column, has to be one of the values contained in the mapped column in the primary key table
-- NULL also is acceptable in a Foreign key column
### Create FK
```sql
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 
        1
    FROM sys.foreign_keys 
    WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn') -- foreign key constraint name
    AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ForeignKeyTable') -- table name
    AND referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.PrimaryKeyTable') -- referenced table name
)
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE ForeignKeyTable ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn
        FOREIGN KEY (ForeignKeyColumn) REFERENCES PrimaryKeyTable (PrimaryKeyColumn);
END
```

### DROP FK
```sql
IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 
        1
    FROM sys.foreign_keys 
    WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn') -- foreign key constraint name
    AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ForeignKeyTable') -- table name
    AND referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.PrimaryKeyTable') -- referenced table name
)
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE ForeignKeyTable DROP CONSTRAINT FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn;
END
```

### DROP (when the name is auto generated)
```sql
IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 
        1
    FROM sys.foreign_keys 
    WHERE parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ForeignKeyTable') -- table name
    AND referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.PrimaryKeyTable') -- referenced table name
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE @ConstraintName NVARCHAR(100);
    SELECT @ConstraintName = name
		FROM sys.foreign_keys 
		WHERE referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'PrimaryKeyTable')
	AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'ForeignKeyTable');

	 EXEC('ALTER TABLE ForeignKeyTable DROP CONSTRAINT ' + @ConstraintName)
END
```
