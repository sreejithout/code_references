## NoSQL
### Pros
- all the relevant data are contained in on block
- insertions and retrievals are faster than RDBMS
- schema is easily changable.
- they have horizontal partitioning in built. Means, they are built for scale. (sharding)
- Built for metrics / analytics / aggregations
- usually used for analytics
### Cons
- Update = Delete + Insert (It's expensive)
- Data may not be consistent (for this reason, financial systems don't use these for transactions)
- Not optimised to read from multiple docs
- No implicit relations
- Joins are hard

## RDBMS
### Pros
- All cons of NoSQL
- ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

### Cons
- Adding new columns are expensive
- joining between tables are expensive
