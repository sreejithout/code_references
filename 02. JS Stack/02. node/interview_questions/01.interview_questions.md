## What is Node.js Process Model?
- Node.js runs in a single process and the application code runs in a single thread and thereby needs less resources than other platforms. 
- All the user requests to your web application will be handled by a single thread and all the I/O work or long running job is performed asynchronously for a particular request. 
- So, this single thread doesn't have to wait for the request to complete and is free to handle the next request. 
- When asynchronous I/O work completes then it processes the request further and sends the response.
