## Selecting Specific fields from documents in a collection
    - we need to specify the fields as "1" or "0"

### with the key "_id"
```js
db.collection.find({}, {"city": 1, "tax": 1,...}) 
// this will return the entries with city, tax and _id
```
### without the key "_id"
```js
db.collection.find({}, {"city": 1, "_id": 0}) 
// this will return the entries with city, tax and _id
```
