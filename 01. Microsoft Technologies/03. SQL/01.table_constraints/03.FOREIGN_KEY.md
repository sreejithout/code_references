## Foreign Keys
- Foreign Keys are used to enforce database integrity.
- It will prevent actions that would destroy links between tables. 
- The foreign key constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column.
- A FOREIGN KEY is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.
- NULL also is acceptable in a Foreign key column
- The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.
### Create FK
```sql
IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 
        1
    FROM sys.foreign_keys 
    WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn') -- foreign key constraint name
    AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ForeignKeyTable') -- table name
    AND referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.PrimaryKeyTable') -- referenced table name
)
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE ForeignKeyTable 
    WITH CHECK
    ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn
        FOREIGN KEY (ForeignKeyColumn) REFERENCES PrimaryKeyTable (PrimaryKeyColumn);
    -- ON UPDATE CASCADE
    -- ON DELETE CASCADE
END
```
### DROP FK
```sql
IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 
        1
    FROM sys.foreign_keys 
    WHERE object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn') -- foreign key constraint name
    AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ForeignKeyTable') -- table name
    AND referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.PrimaryKeyTable') -- referenced table name
)
BEGIN
    ALTER TABLE ForeignKeyTable DROP CONSTRAINT FK_ForeignKeyTable_ForeignKeyColumn;
END
```

### DROP (when the name is auto generated)
```sql
IF EXISTS (
    SELECT 
        1
    FROM sys.foreign_keys 
    WHERE parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.ForeignKeyTable') -- table name
    AND referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'dbo.PrimaryKeyTable') -- referenced table name
)
BEGIN
    DECLARE @ConstraintName NVARCHAR(100);
    SELECT @ConstraintName = name
		FROM sys.foreign_keys 
		WHERE referenced_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'PrimaryKeyTable')
	AND parent_object_id = OBJECT_ID(N'ForeignKeyTable');

	 EXEC('ALTER TABLE ForeignKeyTable DROP CONSTRAINT ' + @ConstraintName)
END
```

### CASCADE
-- https://www.sqlshack.com/delete-cascade-and-update-cascade-in-sql-server-foreign-key/
#### DELETE CASCADE
- When we create a foreign key using this option, it deletes the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced row is deleted in the parent table which has a primary key.
- we cannot create INSTEAD OF DELETE on the table when a foreign key CASCADE DELETE rule already exists on the table.
#### UPDATE CASCADE
- When we create a foreign key using UPDATE CASCADE the referencing rows are updated in the child table when the referenced row is updated in the parent table which has a primary key.
- we cannot create INSTEAD OF UPDATE on the table when a foreign key CASCADE UPDATE rule already exists on the table.
