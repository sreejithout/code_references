## IEnumerable
- namespace is System.Collections
- The IEnumerable is used to iterate a read-only collection. It has only one method, GetEnumerator(), that allows you to iterate the read-only collection using a foreach loop. It only iterates in the forward direction.
- Does not support lazy loading. So not recommended for paging kind of scenarios.

## IQueryable
- namespace is System.Linq
-  IQueryable is used to iterate remote data source such as a database or web service.
- Does support lazy loading. So we can also use this for paging
