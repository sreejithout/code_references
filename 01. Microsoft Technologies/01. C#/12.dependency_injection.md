- Dependency injection is a design pattern. 
- Here, instead of creating an object of a class in another class (dependent class) directly, we are passing the object as an argument in the constructor of the dependent class. 
- It helps to write loosely coupled code and helps to make the code more modular and easy to test.


# There are 3 ways to achieve dependency injection.

## Constructor Injection
- This is the most commonly used Injection type. 
- In constructor injection, we can pass the dependency into the constructor. 
- We have to make sure that we do not have a default constructor here, and the only one should be a parameterized constructor.
## Property Injection
- There are cases when we need the default constructor of a class.
- In that case, we can use property injection.
## Method Injection
- When the entire class does not require that dependency, there is no need to implement constructor injection. 
- When we have a dependency on multiple objects, then instead of passing that dependency in the constructor, we pass that dependency in the method itself where it is required.
