Constructor chaining is a way to connect two or more classes in a relationship as Inheritance. 
In Constructor Chaining, every child class constructor is mapped to a parent class Constructor implicitly by base keyword, so when you create an instance of the child class, it will call the parent's class Constructor. 
Without it, inheritance is not possible.
