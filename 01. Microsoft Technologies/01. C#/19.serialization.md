# Serialization
- When we want to send an object through a network, then we have to convert that object into a stream of bytes. 
- Serialization is a process of converting an object into a stream of bytes. 
- To facilitate the object for serializable, it should implement ISerialize Interface. 
- The process of De-serialization is the reverse process of creating an object from a stream of bytes.
