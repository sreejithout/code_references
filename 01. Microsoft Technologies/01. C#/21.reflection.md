# Reflection
- Reflection is when managed code can read its own metadata to find assemblies.
- "Reflection provides objects (of type Type) that describe assemblies, modules, and types.
- You can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object and invoke its methods or access its fields and properties.
