# Anonymous Types
- Anonymous types allow us to create new types without defining them. 
- When there is a need to define read-only properties in a single object without defining each type. 
- In that case, we use anonymous types. 
- Here, a compiler generates type and is accessible only for the current block of code.

```c#
var anonymousData = new
{
    FirstName = "John",
    LastName = "lastname"
};
```
