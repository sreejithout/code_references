# var & dynamic

## var
- The compiler automatically detects the type of a variable at the compile-time based on the value assigned to it. 
- We cannot declare a var type variable without assigning a value to it. 
- The value of the var type variable cannot be changed later in the code.

## dynamic
- We can change the value of a variable of type dynamic in the code later. 
- It also decides the type of the variable based on the value assigned to it at run-time.

```csharp
dynamic someValue = 21;
someValue = "name";
```
