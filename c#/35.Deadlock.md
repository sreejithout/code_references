## Deadlock
- A deadlock is a situation that arises when a process isn't able to complete it's execution because two or more than two processes are waiting for each other to finish. 
- This usually occurs in multi-threading. 
- In this, a shared resource is being held up by a process and another process is waiting for the first process to get over or release it, and the thread holding the locked item is waiting for another process to complete.
