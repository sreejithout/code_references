# Generics
- Generics 
    - increase performance, 
    - increase type safety, 
    - reduce repeated code, thus makes reusable code. 
- Using generics, we can create collection classes. 
It is preferred to use System.Collections.Generic namespace instead of classes such as ArrayList in the System.Collections namespace to create a generic collection.
