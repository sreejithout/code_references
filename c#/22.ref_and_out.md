- An argument passed as ref must be initialized before passing to the method
- out parameter needs not to be initialized before passing to a method.

# ref 
- The parameter or argument must be initialized first before it is passed to ref.	
- It is not required to assign or initialize the value of a parameter from the called method.
- Passing a parameter value by ref is useful when the called method is also needed to modify the pass parameter.
- It is not compulsory to initialize a parameter value before using it in a calling method.
- When we use ref, data can be passed bi-directionally.

# out
- It is not compulsory to initialize a parameter or argument before it is passed to an out.
- The called method is required to assign a value of a parameter before returning.
- Declaring a parameter to an out method is useful when multiple values need to be returned from a function or method.
- A parameter value must be initialized within the calling method before its use.
- When we use out, data is passed only in a unidirectional way (from the called method to the caller method).

# Common for both
Both ref and out are treated differently at run time and they are treated the same at compile time.
Properties are not variables, therefore it cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter.
