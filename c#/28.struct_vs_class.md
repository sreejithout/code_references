Class and struct are both user-defined data types, but have some major differences:
 
## Struct
- Struct is a value type in C# and it inherits from System.Value Type.
- Struct is usually used for smaller amounts of data.
- Struct canâ€™t be inherited from other types.
- Struct can't be abstract.
- No need to create an object with a new keyword.
- Do not have permission to create any default constructor.

## Class
- The class is a reference type in C# and it inherits from the System.Object Type.
- Classes are usually used for large amounts of data.
- Classes can be inherited from other classes.
- A class can be an abstract type.
- We can create a default constructor
