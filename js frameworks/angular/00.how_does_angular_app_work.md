### How does an angular application work?
1. Every Angular app consists of file named angular.json
    - While building the app, the builder looks at this file to find the entry point of the application.
    - Inside the build section, the main property of the options object defines the entry point of the application which in default case is main.ts.
    - assets, styles are binded from here. 
    ```json
     "build": {
        "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
        "options": {
          "outputPath": "dist/angular-starter",
          "index": "src/index.html",
          "main": "src/main.ts",
          "polyfills": "src/polyfills.ts",
          "tsConfig": "tsconfig.app.json",
          "aot": false,
          "assets": [
            "src/favicon.ico",
            "src/assets"
          ],
          "styles": [
            "./node_modules/@angular/material/prebuilt-themes/deeppurple-amber.css",
            "src/style.css"
          ]
        }
      }
    ```
2. main.ts creates a browser environment for the application to run, and along with this, it also calls a function called bootstrapModule, which bootstraps the application.
    ```ts
    import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
    import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
    platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule)
    ```
3. AppModule is the main module declared in the app.module.ts file. It contains 
    - the main module imports the BrowserModule
    - the main module imports the AppRoutingModule
    - imports any other third party or custom defined modules.
    - declares all the components including AppComponent
    - it also bootstraps the AppComponent
    ```ts
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';

    @NgModule({
    declarations: [
        AppComponent,
        BlogComponentComponent
    ],
    imports: [
        BrowserModule,
        AppRoutingModule
    ],
    providers: [],
    bootstrap: [AppComponent]
    })
    export class AppModule { }
    ```
4. AppComponent is declared in app.component.ts
    - this file interacts with the webpage and serves data to it.

    ```ts
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';

      @Component({
        selector: 'app-root',
        templateUrl: './app.component.html',
        styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
      })
      export class AppComponent {
        title = 'angular';
      }
      ```
5. Each Component is delared with three properties
    - selector -> used for accessing the component
    - template / templateUrl -> contains HTML of the component
    - styleUrls -> contains component-specific stylesheets
6. After this, angular calls the index.html
    - it's defined in angular.json Inside the build section, as the index property of the options object
    - This file calles the root component <app-root> which is defined as selector in AppComponent
