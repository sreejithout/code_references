- Services in Angular
		- Singleton objects in Angular that gets instantiated only once during the lifetime of an application
		- Organizes and share data and function with various components and directive
	- Advantages
		- Ability to add custom directives
		- Animation and Event Handlers
		- Follows MVC Pattern
		- Static and Angular Template
		- Two way data binding
		- Dependency injection
	- Disadvantages
		- Complex SPA
		- Dynamic Applications
		- Learning Curve
	- String Interpolation
		- {{your variable}}
	- Authentication
		- user credentials are passed to API
		- after validation at server side, 
			- a JWT Token is returned
			- JWT has information or attributes regarding the current user
			- The user is identified with the JWT
	- Authorization
		- Different users have different access.
		- The level of access of Authorization
	- Annotation
	- Directives
		- Component
		- Structural
		- Attribute
	- Data Binding
		- String Interpolation

Forms
+++++++++++++++++++++++++
	Common form foundation classes
  	  Both reactive and template-driven forms are built on the following base classes.
		FormControl tracks the value and validation status of an individual form control.
		FormGroup tracks the same values and status for a collection of form controls.
		FormArray tracks the same values and status for an array of form controls.
		ControlValueAccessor creates a bridge between Angular FormControl instances and native DOM elements.
