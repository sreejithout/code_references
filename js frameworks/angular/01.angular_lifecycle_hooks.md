# Lifecycle Hooks
- Every component in Angular has a lifecycle
- Different phases it goes through from the time of creation to the time it's destroyed. 
- Angular provides hooks to tap into these phases and trigger changes at specific phases in a lifecycle.

1. ngOnChanges()
    - This hook/method is called before ngOnInit
    - and whenever one or more input properties of the component changes.
    - This method/hook receives a SimpleChanges object which contains the previous and current values of the property.
2. ngOnInit()
    - This hook gets called once, after the ngOnChanges hook.
    - It initializes the component and sets the input properties of the component.
3. ngDoCheck()
    - It gets called after ngOnChanges and ngOnInit and is used to detect and act on changes that cannot be detected by Angular.
    - We can implement our change detection algorithm in this hook. 
4. ngAfterContentInit()
    - It gets called after the first ngDoCheck hook. 
    - This hook responds after the content gets projected inside the component.
5. ngAfterViewInit()
    - It responds after a component's view, or a child component's view is initialized.
6. ngAfterViewChecked()
    - It gets called after ngAfterViewInit, and it responds after the component's view, or the child component's view is checked.
7. ngOnDestroy()
    -  It gets called just before Angular destroys the component. 
    - This hook can be used to clean up the code and detach event handlers.
